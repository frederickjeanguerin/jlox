# Binary operator
Operator > ¤ true > 5 ¤ at '>', left operand, number expected
Operator > ¤ 5 > true ¤ at '>', right operand, number expected
Operator > ¤ true > true ¤ at '>', left operand, number expected
Operator >= ¤ true >= 5 ¤ at '>=', left operand, number expected
Operator < ¤ true < 5 ¤ at '<', left operand, number expected
Operator <= ¤ true <= 5 ¤ at '<=', left operand, number expected
Operator - ¤ true - 5 ¤ at '-', left operand, number expected
Operator * ¤ true * 5 ¤ at '[*]', left operand, number expected
Operator / ¤ true / 5 ¤ at '/', left operand, number expected

# Operator +
Operator + incompatible operands ¤ true + false ¤ at '[+]', operands cannot be added
Operator + incompatible operands ¤ 1 + false ¤ at '[+]', operands cannot be added
Operator + incompatible operands ¤ false + 1 ¤ at '[+]', operands cannot be added

# Division by zero
Division by zero ¤ 3 / 0 ¤ at '/', division by zero
Division by zero ¤ 0 / 0 ¤ at '/', division by zero
Division by zero ¤ 1.5 / 0 ¤ at '/', division by zero
Division by zero ¤ 1.5 % 0 ¤ at '%', division by zero

# Unary operator
Unary - ¤ - true ¤ at '-', right operand, number expected

# Undefined variables (symbols)
Undefined symbol in expression ¤ a ¤ at 'a', undefined symbol 'a'
Undefined symbol in multiple expression ¤ b + a ¤ at 'b', undefined symbol 'b'
Undefined symbol in assignment ¤ a = 10 ¤ at 'a', undefined symbol 'a'
Undefined symbol in chained assignment ¤ var a; c = b = a = 10 ¤ at 'b', undefined symbol 'b'
Uninitialized variable ¤ var a; 10 + a + 5 ¤ at 'a', uninitialized variable 'a'

# Block scope
Undefined variable out of scope ¤ var b = 20; { var a = 10; } b + a ¤ undefined symbol 'a'

# For loop
For loop local variable out of scope ¤ for (var a = 0; a < 5; a = a + 1); a ¤ undefined symbol 'a'

# Increment & Decrement
Increment boolean ¤ var i = true; ++i ¤ at 'i', expected 'Double' but got 'Boolean'
Decrement string ¤ var str = "a"; --str ¤ at 'str', expected 'Double' but got 'String'
Decrement nil ¤ var str = nil; --str ¤ at 'str', expected 'Double' but got 'Void'
